See [The Good Docs Project method articles](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-good-docs-project-method-articles) for more information about what a method article is.


## Definition of done
Method articles are written using the same processes, workflows, and teams as a template project. However, they are published on the website instead of in the template repository.

A method article template project is considered complete when it has progressed through all the template writing phases and when it has been merged into the website.


### Method article writing phases
To be considered complete, a method article must progress through each template writing phase:

- [ ] **Research phase** - When you first start a method article, you begin by researching examples and best practices for that article. This phase ends when you create your *resources* document for that article.
- [ ] **Rough draft phase** - After you conclude your research, you create a draft of your method article in Google Docs. This phase ends when you schedule your drafts for review by other members of your working group or community.
- [ ] **Community review phase** - When your method article is ready for review, your working group lead will schedule 1-2 sessions in the community where other members of the project will review and provide feedback on your template files deliverables. This phase ends after you incorporate the feedback into your draft and your drafts are in a final state.
- [ ] **Final review phase** - When your method article is in a final state, you convert it from Google Docs into Markdown and [open a merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html) to add your template to the website repository. The template leads will review the template and possibly request additional changes. This phase ends when the article is merged into the repository.

See the [Templates CONTRIBUTING guide](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance about these phases. You can also receive help from your working group leads and members about how to move your template project through each phase.
