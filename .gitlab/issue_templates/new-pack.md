{Add a description of the template pack, use case, and intended audience.}

See [Template packs](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#template-packs) for more information about what a template pack is.


## Templates that are planned for this template pack
The following templates are planned for this template pack:

- [ ] {Template name} - {issue link}
- [ ] {Template name} - {issue link}
- [ ] {Template name} - {issue link}
- [ ] {Template name} - {issue link}
- [ ] {Template name} - {issue link}


## Definition of done
A template pack can be released as soon as it has at least at least one of each template that is:

- Task-oriented
- Concept-oriented
- Reference-oriented

The template pack can be released if it has one of each of these types of templates, but the issue can't be closed until all planned templates are complete.

A template pack is released when it is included on our README file or our website. All new or enhanced template packs should be included in the release notes.


## Want to work on this template pack?
Great! The best way to contribute is to work on one of the templates that are part of the pack. See the issue for that specific template for more information.
